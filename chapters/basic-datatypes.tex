\chapter{Basic datatypes}\label{basic-datatypes}

In this chapter we will work with the most basic datatypes, numbers and strings. Start your Python REPL and write the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> a = 2
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> b = 2.5
>>> type(b)
<class 'float'>
\end{lstlisting}

Basically, you are declaring two variables (named "a" and "b") which will hold some numbers: variable "a" is an integer number while variable "b" is a real number. We can now use our variables or any other numbers to do some calculations:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> a + b
4.5
>>> (a + b) * 2
9.0
>>> 2 + 2 + 4 - 2/3
7.333333333333333
\end{lstlisting}

Python also has support for string datatypes. Strings are sequences of characters (like words) and can be defined using single or double quotes:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> hi = "hello"
>>> hi
'hello'
>>> bye = 'goodbye'
>>> bye
'goodbye'
\end{lstlisting}

You can add strings to concatenate them but you can not mix different datatypes, such as strings and integers.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> hi + "world"
'helloworld'
>>> "Hello" + 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: must be str, not int
\end{lstlisting}

However, multiplication works as repetition:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> "Hello" * 3
'HelloHelloHello'
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Exercises with numbers}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Try the following mathematical calculations and guess what is happening: $(3 / 2)$, $(3 // 2)$, $(3 \% 2)$, $(3**2)$.

Suggestion: check the Python library reference at \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex}.

\item Calculate the average of the following sequences of numbers: (2, 4), (4, 8, 9), (12, 14/6, 15)

\item The volume of a sphere is given by $4/3\pi r^3$. Calculate the volume of a sphere of radius 5. Suggestion: create a variable named "pi" with the value of 3.1415.

\item Use the module operator (\%) to check which of the following numbers is even or odd: (1, 5, 20, 60/7).

Suggestion: the remainder of $x/2$ is always zero when $x$ is even.

\item Find some values for $x$ and $y$ such that $x < 1/3 < y$ returns "True" on the Python REPL. Suggestion: try $0 < 1/3 < 1$ on the REPL.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercises with strings}

Using the Python documentation on strings (\url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#text-sequence-type-str}), solve the following exercises:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Initialize the string "abc" on a variable named "s":
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a function to get the length of the string.
\item Write the necessary sequence of operations to transform the string "abc" in "aaabbbccc". Suggestion: Use string concatenation and string indexes.
\end{enumerate}

\item Initialize the string "aaabbbccc" on a variable named "s":
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a function that allows you to find the first occurence of "b" in the string, and the first occurence of "ccc".
\item Use a function that allows you to replace all occurences of "a" to "X", and then use the same function to change only the first occurence of "a" to "X".
\end{enumerate}

\item Starting from the string "aaa bbb ccc", what sequences of operations do you need to arrive at the following strings? You can use the "replace" function.
\begin{enumerate}
\item "AAA BBB CCC"
\item "AAA bbb CCC"
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
