# At full speed with Python

This book aims to teach the basics of the python programming language using a practical approach. Its method is quite basic though: after a very simple introduction to each topic, the reader is invited to learn by solving the proposed exercises.

These exercises have been used extensively in my web development and distributed computing classes at the Superior School of Technology of Set√∫bal. With these exercises, most students are at full speed with Python in less than a month. In fact, students of the distributed computing course, taught in the second year of the software engineering degree, become familiar with Python's syntax in two weeks and are able to implement a distributed client-server application with sockets in the third week.

This book is made available in github (\url{https://github.com/joaoventura/full-speed-python}) so I appreciate any pull requests to correct misspellings or to suggest new exercises or clarification of the current content.
